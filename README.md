# Credit-card-fraud-transactions-detection-using-ml-techniques
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, particular attention was paid to handling class imbalance to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to detect fraud effectively.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (Credit Card Fraud Detection), contains a total of 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are labeled as fraudulent.
